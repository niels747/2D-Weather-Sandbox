# In Progress
- [ ] Improve realistic hail formation and improve precipitation in general
- [ ] Improve precipitation spawning system
- [ ] Make behaviour of precipitation scale with the vertical resolution to fix unrealistic behavior at resolution lower than 300

# Future:
- [ ] Make soil and vegetation color change with soil moisture
- [ ] Improve Lake/Sea depth visualization, show the water depth under sim area and add 45 deg slopes underwater
- [ ] Add urban surface type with building textures
- [ ] Add realistic albedo's for different surface types
- [ ] Add dynamic vegetation option. Vegetation will grow when soil is wet, and die if to dry
- [ ] Make weather stations show history in plots
- [ ] Improve terain generation
- [ ] Allow editing while simulation paused
- [ ] Make precipitation work on mobile devices
- [ ] Add sounds
- [ ] Add lightning effect
- [ ] Add plane flying mode. You will be able to fly a realistic plane trough the clouds at realistic scale and speed
- [ ] Add forces to simulate coriolis effect and pressure systems to make weather more dynamic
- [ ] Add weather balloons
